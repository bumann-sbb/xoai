The experiments were designed to explore the effects of micronutrients in the yield of upland rice. The experiments were carried out on farmer’s field during the 2018 production cycle, the dataset contains yield and aerial biomass of the experiments.</dc:description><dc:subject>Agricultural Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Earth and Environmental Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Upland rice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Micronutrients</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crop yield</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc</dc:subject><dc:subject>Boron</dc:subject><dc:subject>Latin America and the Caribbean</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multifunctional Landscapes</dc:subject><dc:language>Spanish, Castilian</dc:language><dc:date>2019-02</dc:date><dc:contributor>Garcia, Carolina</dc:contributor><dc:type>Experimental Data</dc:type><dc:type>Environmental Data</dc:type></oai_dc:dc>
